"""
Scenario: Forgery by Verifier (Transferability Attack).

Demonstrates QDS transferability (why QDS is a signature, not just a MAC):
Bob fabricates revealed keys claiming exactly his own measured basis and outcome
at each position.
When submitted to Bob, Bob ACCEPTS (expected: mismatch rate = 0).
When the exact same fabrication is submitted to Charlie, Charlie REJECTS
(mismatch rate ~ 0.5 because Charlie chose bases independently).
